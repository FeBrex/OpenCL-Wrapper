OpenCL Utility Toolkit
==================

The OpenCL Utility Toolkit contains C++ Wrapper classes for a more convient utilization of the OpenCL API. It allows to efficiently instantiate platforms, device, contexts, queues and other OpenCL objects taking the pain to work with C-functions. The Tutorial folder provides basic examples how multiple objects are instantiated and worked with. In order to test the examples you need to create the static library which contains all necessary C++ classes. The toolkit is tested under Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit with the GCC Version 4.6.3 and Intel, AMD/ATI and Nvidia OpenCL drivers featuring the OpenCL standard 1.1.
